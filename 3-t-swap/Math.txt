---------- Swap "10 USDC" for "1 WETH" ----------
-------------------------------------------------


We have two pools

1. Pool one = 100 WETH 
2. Pool two = 1000 USDC

Ratio price between the pools are = 1 WETH = 10 USDC


-------------------------------------------------
------ USER(A) Swap "10 USDC" for "1 WETH" ------
-------------------------------------------------

User(A) comes and put 10 USDC in pool ONE

Pool one = 99
Pool two = 1010


New Ration is now 1010/99 = 10.2 
-> means 1 WETH = 10.2 USDC , becuase WETH demand increased the WETH price



-------------------------------------------------
----- USER(B) Swap "1 WETH " for "10 USDC" ------
-------------------------------------------------


Buy 10.2 USDC for 1 WETH means little cheaper



Pool one = 100
Pool two = 1010-10.02 = 999.8

New Ration is now 999/8/100 = 9.998 

-> means 1 WETH = 9.998 USDC , becuase USDC demand decreased the WETH price
