============================ Uniswap V1 : ETH - ERC20s ==============================

-> UniswapV1Exchange is responsible for token listing, swapping, buying, selling, adding liquidity, remove liquidity etc. 
Each exchange contract holds one token at a time against the deposited ETH.

-> UniswapV1Factory is a registory, which tracks the entire exchanges contracts and from where any one can check which exchange 
holds how much amount of ERC20s.
